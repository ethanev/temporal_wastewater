# temporal_wastewater - Note code not uploaded yet...will be once paper is published =)
Data and python and ipython notebooks for the analysis of the wastewater from three buildings. After XCMS processing you should have a nice .mgf file for MS2 in silico metabolite mapping and a .csv file for metabolite mass look up as well as the following analysis:
Notebook can be (and frankly should be) used in the following order:
  1) data_processing.ipynb
  2) splitting_stable_unstable_metabs.ipynb
  now its more a free for all to replicate what I did! have fun
  3) MIT_longitudinal_exploration.ipynb
  4) building_and_day_classification.ipynb
  5) metab_stories_from_classification_and_clustering.ipynb
  6) MIT_longitudinal_exploration.ipynb
